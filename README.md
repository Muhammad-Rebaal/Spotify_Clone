## Authentication and Token Handling

To access Spotify's data and enable playback, the application uses OAuth 2.0 authentication and obtains access tokens. Here's a simplified overview of the process:

1. **User Authentication**: Users log in with their Spotify accounts through the app.
2. **Authorization Request**: The app requests authorization from the Spotify Accounts service.
3. **Access Token**: Upon user approval, the app receives an access token.
4. **API Requests**: The access token is included in API requests to fetch user data and control playback.
5. **Token Expiry**: Access tokens expire after a short period. The app handles token refresh to maintain user sessions.
